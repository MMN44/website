## General description

The goal of the NeOn project (Lifecycle support for networked ontologies - FP6-027595) was to advance the state of the art in Ontological Engineering and Semantic Web technologies.

The main objective was to provide effective methodological and technological support for the development of a new generation of semantic applications that are capable of efficiently exploiting large amounts of information and data that are currently available on the Web. The project also aimed to improve the ability to manage multiple ontology networks that exist in a particular context, that are developed collaboratively, and that could be highly dynamic and constantly evolving.

The NeOn project has developed both the technological support, called the NeOn Toolkit, and the associated methodology, the NeOn Methodology, to make possible the development of the new generation of complex semantic applications.

## Role of the oeg in this project
OEG has been the leader of the methodological research within the project. OEG has developed the NeOn Methodology framework, which is based on 9 scenarios. OEG has also created the methodological guides for the following processes and activities: Specification of ontology requirements, Planning Reuse of ontological resources, Reuse and re-engineering of non-ontological resources, including patterns for re-engineering, Localization, including the model LIR, Evolution and the OMV. Furthermore, OEG has been involved in the development of different plug-ins for the NeOn Toolkit. Specifically, OEG has developed Oyster, LabelTranslator, gOntt, ODEMapster, OWL Doc. OEG has been involved in the three use cases of the NeOn project, mainly providing methodological help during the development of ontology networks.
