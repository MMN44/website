## General description

BUSCAMEDIA (Towards a multirredmultiterminal Digital Media Adaptation semantics) aims to provide a true semantic multimedia search engine, based on a revolutionary ontology defined in the project (M3 Ontology: multilingual, multidomain, and multimedia). The semantic multimedia search engine dynamically adapts to any network, terminal, context and user (both professional users and end users).

## Role of the oeg in this project
The OEG is involved in the development of ontologies that represent multimedia information, taking into account a multilingual context and applicable to several domains. The objective is to build an ontology, M3 (multilingual, multidomain, and multimedia) that will be used by the semantic multimedia search engine. Furthermore, the OEG is involved in the construction of ontologies that represent user profiles, which can be used to personalize multimedia searches. This customization should be done based on user preferences, relevant content, and user context.
