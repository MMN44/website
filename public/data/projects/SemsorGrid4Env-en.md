## General description

The main objective of the SemsorGrid4Env project is to specify, design, implement, evaluate and deploy a service-oriented platform and architecture that allows the development of applications on sensor networks for large-scale environmental management and using semantic technology.

Such a platform and architecture will allow the rapid development of lightweight applications (eg mashups) that require real-time data from heterogeneous sensor networks, making it possible to use it for purposes other than those originally conceived (thus reducing the cost of deploying sensor networks) and combining real-time data with historical data from other sources, opening possibilities to improve decision-making procedures in a variety of situations (emergencies, monitoring, etc.).

## Role of the oeg in this project
UPM acts as coordinator of this project. She is also involved in the development of ontologies to create semantic descriptions of sensor networks and other types of data sources, and the information they provide. This work is aligned with that of the W3C group on semantic sensor networks (W3C incubator in Semantic Sensor Netwoks), in which UPM participates and several ontologies are being generated as a result, covering aspects related to generic descriptions of these data sources and to the selection of domain ontologies for SSG4Env use cases in fire prevention and fire risk alerts.

Finally, UPM is also working on extending SPARQL, the R2O language and the ODEMapster technology (see details) to process continuous data sources from sensor networks, allowing the execution of SPARQLstr queries, which are translated into the SNEEql query language and converted then in executable code in the nodes of a sensor network.


## Some relevant results
This section will include descriptions of some of the most relevant results of the project as they are produced.
