## General description

In this project, a platform will be created that will integrate new methods, techniques and tools to allow the integration of heterogeneous scientific data sources through the use of ontologies, based on the advances made in the last two decades in this area and incorporating new types from data sources from researchers' social networks, from the Linked Data website, and from sensor networks.

The project will build on the advances that the research group is making in the following basic research areas, providing methods, techniques and tools to:

* Ontology-based access to available data sources such as data streams, coming or not from sensor networks, and for querying within the network in the case of sensor networks;
* The characterization of data sources unknown a priori from the information available on other related data sources;
* The extraction of knowledge from folksonomies available on social networks, and its integration with other sources of knowledge;
* The planning of consultations to distributed data sources based on criteria of quality, of the information (for example, provenance) and of the service (for example, cost of access) provided by the information sources;
* The distribution and optimization of queries to distributed RDF data sources, available as SPARQL access points (SPARQL endpoints) .;
* The publication of integrated data as quality Linked Data.

And all these individual advances will be integrated into a single data integration model that allows access and integration of all these types of sources in a domain-independent way, and that will be demonstrated through a user-centric platform that integrates all of these. services.
