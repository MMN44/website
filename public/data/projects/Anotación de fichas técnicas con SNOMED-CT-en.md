## General description

The annotation of technical sheets of medicines with SNOMED-CT is a collaborative project with the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products (AEMPS).

The overall objective of the project is to develop a system capable of extracting diseases from the therapeutic indications of the technical sheets of medicines (diseases for which the medicine has been prescribed) and seeking the correspondence (mapping) with the SNOMED-CT medical terminology. The annotation of diseases through the mapping process with SNOMED-CT will allow the representation of the content of the technical sheets for their automatic and unequivocal interpretation between different systems, accurately and in different languages, thus facilitating the use of relevant information for the clinical decision making.
