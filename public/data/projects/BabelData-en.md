## General description

BabelData will develop methods, techniques and algorithms for the construction of services that are capable of creating and using multilingual ontologies and data. In the Semantic Web of the future, multilinguality is presented as one of the great challenges to be addressed. Despite the fact that the problem of knowledge processing has been considered independent of any natural language, the interaction between humans and machines is still dependent on language. 

Language is the way humans have to communicate about facts or data, and this communication is preferably done in our own language. Therefore, in the Semantic Web of the future, access to semantically structured data and linked data (Linked Data) should be done in a multilingual environment. To achieve the project objectives, the following aspects will be worked on: Automatic localization of ontologies, Multilingual mapping between ontologies in different languages, Models, methods, techniques and tools for the generation of multilingual Linked Data, Services for the integration of multilingual ontologies and Multilingual Linked Data
