## General description

Wf4Ever will propose a software architecture and reference implementation for the efficient conservation, recovery and reuse of scientific workflows, addressing some of the biggest challenges of Data-intensive Science (data-intensive science):

* (a) The study of research objects (Research Objects) that are part of workflows or that are related to them. This also includes aspects related to the provenance (provenance) of their executions.

* (b) The development of tools that support the access, manipulation, distribution, reuse and evolution of these research objects.

* (c) Support for the comprehensive management of the life cycle of workflows and their associated materials.

The Wf4Ever implementation will be based on one of the most widely used workflow support platforms (myExperiment), extending it with functionalities related to the management and conservation of these research objects related to scientific workflows, with the support to the collaboration and exchange of these objects, and with mechanisms to ensure the maintenance of the integrity and authenticity of the workflows.

Wf4Ever will apply all these scientific and technological results in the context of two scientific domains characterized by the use of scientific workflows:

* Astronomy, as a web service, a data and metadata rich discipline, is beginning to develop as a workflow-oriented approach, so Preservation can be taken into account from the beginning. Several different workflows will be presented, which also represent different challenges from a conservation point of view.
* Genomics, a discipline that requires the access and integration of various data formats rich in metadata. The sheer volume of data production already requires standardized approaches to data preservation, experimental methods, and metadata.

The Wf4Ever tools will be used to preserve and reproduce workflows in support of human disease studies, demonstrating the reuse of knowledge between disease studies. A more detailed description of this project is provided on the project website.



## Role of the oeg in this project
UPM will lead a work package on the evolution, exchange and collaboration of workflows, whose main objective is to provide the appropriate means to maximize the participation and reuse of the conserved Research Objects, while supporting to its evolution and versioning and collaboration between scientists will be facilitated. This will overcome the limited collaborative support for workflow sharing and reuse that exists in most current repository and workflow management systems. To achieve this goal, UPM will exploit the social characteristics that emerge from social networks and complement them with formal models, while taking into account the evolution of Research Objects at the center of the proposed models.


## Some relevant results
This section will include descriptions of some of the most relevant results of the project as they are produced.
