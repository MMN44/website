## General description

Monnet (Multilingual Ontologies for a Knowledge Network) aims to provide a semantics-based solution to guarantee access to information beyond language barriers.

Multilingual access to information is being increasingly demanded in the industry sector and government institutions, as exemplified in the Monnet use cases.

A key strategy to face this challenge consists of managing information at a semantic level, that is, abstracting ourselves from form and language to achieve a better

1. integration,
2. aggregation,
3. consultation and
4. presentation of information, regardless of the language in which it is expressed.

The architecture envisaged in Monnet consists of the following modules or components: the Ontology Localization module, the Information Extraction module based on Multilingual Ontologies, and the Multilingual Access to Knowledge and Information Presentation module.

The central hypotheses of architecture are that

1. Use case data and relevant information will be available in various languages and formats, such as databases, Web documents, Wikipedia, Linked Data or linked data, etc;
2. the knowledge of the use cases, that is, the semantics of the domain, will be modeled in an ontology that will be formalized through the use of an ontology representation language such as RDF / S or OWL, and will specify what the concepts are ( classes, properties, relations) of importance to the domain of the use cases.
