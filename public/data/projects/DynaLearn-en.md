## General description

Conceptual knowledge about the behavior of systems is crucial for society to better understand and interact with its environment. Acquiring such knowledge is a valuable aspect of science education.

DynaLearn (interactive learning environment for systems conceptual knowledge) aims to support the acquisition of conceptual knowledge in the context of environmental science learning, by combining:

- Qualitative reasoning techniques,

- Semantic techniques,

- Animation of virtual characters.


Graphic representations are used for students to articulate, analyze and communicate ideas, and therefore build their conceptual knowledge (https://oeg.fi.upm.es/images/stories/tecnologias/dynalearn-diag.png).

Ontology mapping techniques are used to identify and match different students working on similar ideas, providing individualized learning opportunities and mutual benefits. (Https://oeg.fi.upm.es/images/ stories / technologies / dynalearn-mapp.png).

Virtual characters will be used to make the interaction attractive and motivating.



## Role of the oeg in this project
UPM participates in all activities related to semantic technologies within the DynaLearn system. Specifically, there are three main tasks in which semantics play an important role:

* Grounding. Users will choose the terminology involved in their model from well-formed vocabularies (ontologies), to facilitate their interoperability, as well as to facilitate the creation of a common domain knowledge.

* Feedback (feedback) based on ontologies. Model validation by studying their similarity with certain standard models (using ontolgy mapping techniques) .;

* Recommendation. Collaborative filtering to obtain subjective recommendations based on the user community; as well as recommendations based on the properties of the model from a structural and objective point of view.


## Some relevant results
This section will include descriptions of some of the most relevant results of the project as they are produced.
