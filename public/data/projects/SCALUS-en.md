## General description

Research on storage systems is gaining in importance mainly due to the enormous demand for storage capacity and I / O performance of today's computing systems. In recent years, several trends have changed the design of storage systems, from new storage media on storage area networks, to grid and cloud storage systems. Additionally, to decrease the cost of storage systems, they are increasingly built from the assembly of commodity components. Therefore, we are in the middle of an evolution towards a new storage architecture developed from decentralized commodity components with greater processing and communication capacities, which requires the introduction of new concepts arising from this new architecture.

The main objective of the consortium of this Marie Curie Initial Training Network (MCITN) "SCALing by means of Ubiquitous Storage (SCALUS)" is to improve and innovate education, research and development of storage systems in cluster, grid-type environments and cloud. The vision of this MCITN is to lay the foundation for ubiquitous storage systems, which can scale in different directions (capacity, performance, distance, security). Providing solutions to the problem of ubiquitous storage will become an important demand for the future of IT systems and leadership in this area can have a significant impact on European competitiveness in IT technologies. To achieve this leadership, it is necessary to invest in storage education and research and close the current gap between local storage, cluster storage, grid storage, and cloud storage.

The consortium will proceed in this direction by creating an interdisciplinary network for storage education and research. This network is made up of some of the leading European institutes and cluster technology and storage companies, thereby creating a challenging but rewarding environment for young researchers.

## Role of the oeg in this project
The UPM will be involved in the co-supervision of 4 ESRs (Early Stage Researchers) in the achievement of the following tasks:

ESR 3: Autonomic Replica Management - Caching and replication are two similar concepts that have traditionally remained separate in large distributed environments. The goal of this work is the use of client caching (both in memory and on disk) to improve redundancy and performance. Additionally, replication involves not only read-only files, but also read-write files. The students assigned to this work will propose data distribution and localization mechanisms that integrate both caching and replication in an automatic and intelligent way. Finally, it is important that the proposed mechanism scale up to WAN environments to allow cooperation between resources.

ESR 11: Autonomic Management of Data Grids and Cloud Storage: Data grids and cloud storage systems are characterized by their complexity and dynamism. Therefore, the management of resources in this type of environment is complex and decisions made in a moment can be counterproductive shortly afterwards. Knowing the future state of the environment is essential to implement adequate policies in each situation. The student assigned to this work will have to develop an autonomous prediction system that allows the improved management of storage resources in these environments.

ESR 12: High-performance, Secure and Fault Tolerant Grid File System: Fault tolerance is an issue that has not been adequately addressed in storage environments. large scale, due to their complexity. Knowing the behavior of these environments can help prevent certain failures, which results in an improvement of their fault tolerance. The student assigned to this topic will develop fault tolerance strategies based on modeling large-scale storage environments.

ESR 14: Towards a scalable, fault-tolerant, self-adaptive Cloud file system: Data intensive applications running on cloud infrastructures require certain features such as sharing between virtual machines that maintain high performance under high demand for concurrent accesses. These features are not provided by current solutions in cloud environments, such as S3. The objective of this work is to explore the possibilities offered by BlobSeer, a generic data sharing platform that supports large amounts of data, as a storage substrate for a high-level, scalable, fault-tolerant, adaptive file system. and optimized for massive data processing.
