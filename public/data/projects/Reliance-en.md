## General description
This project was born with the objective of supporting scientific communications that work in the Earth Sciences area, including users of Copernicus data, for the creation of research objects (Research Objects) that add not only scientific publications, but also joint data, software, etc., as in other similar initiatives in the area of research objects, but also a special type of data that is extremely important in most of these experiments, such as data cubes (Data Cubes ). In this sense, work is being done on the integration of services around these research objects centered on data cubes with services of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), as well as on the provision of services in EOSC for these scientific and research communities and users.


## Role of the oeg in this project
More specifically, in this project the OEG-UPM is working fundamentally in three areas:

* The definition of a metadata model for data cubes (Data Cubes) that is compatible with the most common metadata standards used by these communities and with the EOSC Interoperability Framework. Cross-walks will be created between all these metadata models and scripts to ensure their proper transformation and registration into a data cube and Research Objects preservation system.
* The integration of the previous metadata model with the Research Objects models that are currently being proposed in the context of EOSC.
* The integration of scientific document processing techniques for the enrichment of scientific articles in this area, as well as for the profiling of scientists according to their research objects.


## Some relevant results
This section will include descriptions of some of the most relevant results of the project as they are produced.
