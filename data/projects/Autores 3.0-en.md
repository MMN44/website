## General description

Authors 3.0 (Online Intellectual Property Registry with Semantic Technology) aims to research and develop information systems to create an online intellectual property registry of original works based on semantic technology. This registry (web service) will provide information on the intellectual property rights of the content circulating on the Internet and will make it possible to create a digital community around the creation and dissemination of content.

## Role of the oeg in this project
The Polytechnic University of Madrid is involved in the development of ontologies to create semantic descriptions of the intellectual property of the works. These ontologies take into account the type of work, the author, the jurisdiction where the work was created and the license applied to said work (with the rights granted and under what requirements). Together, three ontologies will be developed:

* a basic ontology to provide the simplest information,
* a complete one that will take into account all the intellectual property considered in this project
* and, finally, a vertical ontology to describe doctoral theses.


## Some relevant results
This section will include descriptions of some of the most relevant results of the project as they are produced.
