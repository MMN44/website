## General description
TransformingTransport is an EU-funded project the represents a strong consortium of 47 leading transport, logistics and information technology stakeholders in Europe. 

Big Data will have a profound economic and societal impact in the mobility and logistics sector, which is one of the most-used industries in the world contributing to approximately 15% of GDP. Big Data is expected to lead to 500 billion USD in value worldwide in the form of time and fuel savings, and savings of 380 megatons CO2 in mobility and logistics. With freight transport activities projected to increase by 40% in 2030, transforming the current mobility and logistics processes to become significantly more efficient, will have a profound impact. A 10% efficiency improvement may lead to EU cost savings of EUR 100 billion. Despite these promises, interestingly only 19% of EU mobility and logistics companies employ Big Data solutions as part of value creation and business processes. 

The TransformingTransport project will demonstrate, in a realistic, measurable, and replicable way the transformations that Big Data will bring to the mobility and logistics market. To this end, TransformingTransport, validates the technical and economic viability of Big Data to reshape transport processes and services to significantly increase operational efficiency, deliver improved customer experience, and foster new business models. TransformingTransport will address seven pilot domains of major importance for the mobility and logistics sector in Europe: Smart High-ways Sustainable Vehicle Fleets Proactive Rail Infrastructures Ports as Intelligent Logistics Hubs Efficient Air Transport Multi-modal Urban Mobility Dynamic Supply Chains The TransformingTransport consortium combines knowledge and solutions of major European ICT and Big Data technology providers together with the competence and experience of key European industry players in the mobility and logistics domain.



## Role of the oeg in this project
More specifically, in this project the OEG-UPM is working fundamentally in:



## Some relevant results
Results show significant improvements in operational efficiency: Highways achieved 33% of improvement, Connected Vehicles around 6%, Airports 28%, Urban Mobility 55%, whereas E-Commerce improved its efficiency by 46%.
In addition, with respect to CO2 and other emissions such as NOX and PM, savings reach up to 37%.
WP4 has shown outstanding potential in making highways “smarter” by using Big Data to optimise traffic and alert road authorities about unfolding road conditions and incidents.
During the project we have demonstrated that big data can also contribute to decrease waste through savings in operational activities and improved management of assets extending their lifetime and reducing downtime. Final results show a percentage of improvement higher than 32%.
Predictive Terminal Process Analytics has achieved a good balance between high accuracy rate (e.g. avoiding false negative predictions) but also generating predictions as early as possible in order to increase proactiveness, leading to a cost savings of 27 % on average.
Regarding customer experience, TT has shown that overall the optimisation of maintenance activities directly affects rail traffic management. Reducing the number of maintenance interventions will increase the number of trains that can ride daily over the railway tracks.
On the other hand, findings of the Dynamic Supply Networks pilot present various insights about the role of Big Data and business analytics in e-commerce logistics providing innovative services to enhance customer experience
New business models have been tested in cases like the airport domain, thanks to the collaboration established with duty-free operators in the Athens Airport pilot. Finally, TT has also demonstrated the potential of Big Data for improving traffic in the city by exploiting the data generated from the ever-increasing number of sensors.
