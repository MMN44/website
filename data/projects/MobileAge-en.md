## General description
The "Mobile Age" Project ensures the inclusion of older people in the use of digital public services through the development of usable mobile applications based on open data from the Public Administration. Therefore, their access to citizen participation, active aging and their involvement in their community are encouraged. This project will also increase transparency and trust in Public Administration through the exchange and reuse of public information, actively involving older people in order to understand the benefits of open data and mobile technologies. Such mobile applications will be tested in co-creation workshops to be held in four pilot cities in Europe: UK, Germany, Spain and Greece.



## Role of the oeg in this project
More specifically, in this project the OEG-UPM is working fundamentally in:



## Some relevant results
The project led to the development of the Mobile-Age app, which offers services tailored to the needs of senior citizens and is already available in several languages. Furthermore, the project website is now an invaluable platform for app developers to access relevant data efficiently and create their own services. “All of the resources and technological components are open,” says Prof. Hayes.

The Mobile-Age apps that have been developed in each country unleash the potential of open data to support local authorities in delivering public services. In increasingly ‘smart’ cities, open data allow different services to be linked up and provide users with personalised, location-based information. This makes the whole process more efficient, benefitting cities and citizens alike. What’s more, as all members of society become more included in civic participation, and see the benefits of more open, transparent governments, the project believes trust in public institutions will also increase.
