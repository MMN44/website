## General description

The READY4SmartCities project intends to increase awareness and interoperability for the adoption of ICT and semantic technologies in energy system to obtain a reduction of energy consumption and CO2 emission at smart cities communities level through innovative relying on RTD and innovation outcomes and ICT-based solutions. 

The goal is to support: A new energy data ecosystem that will accommodate cross-domain data (climatic, occupation, pollution, traffic, activity, etc.) and will allow the exploitation of such data at global scale; by identifying the set of ontologies relevant to energy-efficiency in Smart Cities and the different requirements and guidelines on how to use (publish and interchange) data described according to those ontologies. A holistic and shared vision, allowing feasible step-by-step action plans for city authorities and other relevant stakeholder groups to develop and use ICT-based solutions for energy system in urban and rural communities towards future Smart Cities, and thus, leading to reduced energy consumption and CO2 emissions.
