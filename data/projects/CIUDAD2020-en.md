Duration: October 2011 - December 2014

Funded by: CDTI - Center for Industrial Technological Development

## General description

CIUDAD2020 is an Innpronta project that aims to achieve progress in the areas of energy efficiency, Internet of the future, Internet of things, human behavior, environmental sustainability and mobility and transport, with the aim of designing the city of the future, sustainable, intelligent and efficient. For this reason, CIUDAD2020 conceives, designs and implements a new paradigm of a sustainable and efficient city based on three fundamental axes: Energy, Transport, Environmental Control.

CIUDAD2020 will achieve the 20-20-20 objectives: Reduction of 20% of emissions, production of 20% of renewable energy and improvement of 20% of energy efficiency. For this, the Internet of the Future is postulated as the basic enabling element capable of stimulating synergies between the aforementioned axes as well as interaction with citizens, making CIUDAD2020 a reference model towards which every city must evolve if it is wants to achieve the standards of quality of life, efficiency and sustainability that should prevail in the cities of the 21st century. To this end, a consortium of companies and OPIS with extensive national and international experience has been formed that ensures the projection of the results obtained during the execution of the proposal.

## Role of the oeg in this project
The Ontology Engineering Group participates in this project through the following use cases:

1 . Information on energy consumption for company facility managers: means will be provided for the transformation and publication of data on energy consumption in buildings for companies, town halls and individuals. These data will be published using standards of the Linked Data Web, and ontologies that will be developed with the spirit of being agreed by a wide sector of "stakeholders", including the European Commission.

2. Information on the location of bicycles from the city's bicycle rental services: It will work to provide Linked Data on bicycles and the rental points at all times, using techniques used in data streaming to identify URIs. Also, some simple application will be developed to show how this data can be used. This application will also make use of meteorological data, and about city events, which may have an impact on the availability of bicycles.

3. Information on meteorological and pollution stations in cities: A way will be provided to publish data from the AEMET meteorological stations in a continuous and frequently updated way (thus improving the work already carried out previously at http: //aemet.linkeddata .es /), and to complete this information with data from the meteorological stations of the cities that join this case study (for example, Zaragoza, Santander through its SmartSantander initiative, etc.). Ontologies will be agreed to represent this data, which will adapt the SSN Ontology developed by the W3C, and data visualization tools will be provided for citizens or citizen scientists. This will be completed with possible data extracted from sources such as Pachube.
