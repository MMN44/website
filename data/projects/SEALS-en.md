## General description

The objective of the SEALS project is to create an independent, open, scalable, expandable and sustainable infrastructure, the SEALS platform, which allows remote evaluation of applications based on semantic technology. This platform will allow researchers, developers and users to effectively and objectively compare applications based on this technology.

The SEALS platform will integrate a set of services and test data for the evaluation of semantic applications that will be used in two global evaluation campaigns. The result of these campaigns will help us determine compatible tool sets for the development of new applications based on this technology. Initially, five different types of semantic applications will be considered: tools for the design of ontologies, systems for storing and reasoning semantic data, systems for aligning heterogeneous ontologies, tools for semantic search and applications for the development and exploitation of semantic web services. The SEALS platform will offer easy and free access to the public results of the evaluations carried out.

## Role of the OEG in this project
UPM is the project coordinator and therefore, responsible for leading the management and administration areas required by the project. UPM also leads the development of the SEALS platform where we are responsible for the implementation of the two main components. Our contributions are also relevant in the organization of the two evaluation campaigns and in the design of the evaluations that will be used in these campaigns.


## Some relevant results
This section will include descriptions of some of the most relevant results of the project as they are produced.
