## General description

ADMIRE (Advanced Data Mining and Integration Research for Europe) is motivated by the difficulty of extracting meaningful information by data mining combinations of multiple heterogeneous and distributed resources.

The project proposes an architecture for data mining and integration, which focuses on separating what is related to experts in the field, experts in data analysis and intensive use of technical data, a language (DISPEL) that can be used to express data mining workflows and integration through user profiles, and the necessary tools and platforms to use this language according to the architecture.

## Role of the OEG in this project
The UPM has participated in the creation of ontologies to create semantic descriptions of data sources and intensive processes, and in providing technologies that make use of semantic descriptions in order to support data-intensive processes, that is, a registry semantic containing descriptions of process elements, functions, and types. This includes the generation of data mining ontologies and data types commonly used in data mining applications, along with the provision of an RDF-enabled OGSA-DAI-compliant registry that is capable of handling SPARQL requests on data-intensive elements available on the platform and provide value-added functionality such as finding processing elements that can replace existing data-intensive workflows.


## Some relevant results
This section will include descriptions of some of the most relevant results of the project as they are produced.
