## General description

PlanetData is a network of excellence whose aim is to establish a sustainable European community of researchers who support organizations in publishing their data in new and useful ways, increasing the ability of organizations to make sense of the huge amounts of data published online. continuously, including structured and unstructured data, data streams, (micro) blog posts, digital archives, e-Science resources, public sector data sets, and linked data from “the cloud”.

The research focuses on a number of key challenges that must be addressed in order to actually expose the data in a serviceable form on a large scale. We will provide data flow representations and scalable techniques for integrating, publishing, and accessing such data resources on the Web. We will define best practices for capturing the context in which data is produced and makes sense - including provenance, and its space, time, and social characteristics - as a means of increasing the effectiveness of data processing and retrieval techniques. Techniques will be provided to assess the quality of the data, record, preserve, and, where possible, improve it through repair techniques, during processing. Finally, in order to attract the exposure of certain types of valuable data sets, it is necessary to take due account of the concerns of its owner to maintain a degree of access control and respect for privacy, without hampering the undisputed use. of the data.

## Role of the oeg in this project
UPM participates in the work thread on data flows and dynamism, exploring the main challenges associated with the dynamism of large-scale data sources, with a special focus on data flows from sources such as news feeds or from continuous sources such as sensor networks. In this sense, the work will be conducted by the UPM in the annotation of the data transmission sources in order to facilitate the processing, mining, and the fusion of said resources, and in the modeling, integration and adaptation to the sources. of unknown and changing data.


## Some relevant results
This section will include descriptions of some of the most relevant results of the project as they are produced.
