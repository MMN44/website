## General description
GOMO establishes an Agile **Go**vernance **Mo**del for BASF ontologies (GOMO). For GOMO to materialize, governance, e.g. roles, accountability, metrics for control, coordination and operational structures, as well as operational guidance, e.g. methods, techniques, best practices, training and, standards need to be defined. For instance, GOMO defines operational principles such as “BASF ontologies are to be made available in a standardized W3C formal language and with PURL-PIDs”. In this example GOMO is explicitly adhering to a body of standards (governance), that of the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) and [OBO](http://www.obofoundry.org/); it is also stating the need for Quality Assurance (QA) tools that verify the compliance with such standards (methodology).  GOMO operationalizes the structure of a network of empowered fit-for-purpose teams having accountable roles (responsibility, authority) doing hands-on governance, materializing communities and, actively engaging with the BASF ecosystem of users and applications.


## Role of the OEG in this project
More specifically, in this project the OEG-UPM is working fundamentally in the development of the content that defines the standards, governing principles, training and methodology of GOMO.
