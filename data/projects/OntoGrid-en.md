## General description

One of the greatest challenges facing Grid computing relates to the explicit ability to share and implement the knowledge that must be used for the development of innovative Grid infrastructures, and for Grid applications - the Semantic Grid.

To meet this challenge, the OntoGrid project produced a technological infrastructure for rapid prototyping and development of knowledge-intensive distributed open services for the Semantic Grid. The results of this project aimed at the development of grid systems that optimize collaboration between processes, companies and industries, which OntoGrid demonstrated by adopting a guided use case development and an evaluation strategy based on two test cases of applications that have different, but stereotyped, Grid characterization.

## Role of the oeg in this project
UPM coordinated this project. In addition, the role of UPM in OntoGrid focused on the provision of access mechanisms to RDF (S) ontologies that comply with the Grid specifications, with the development of WS-DAIOnt-RDF (S) (link), and on the semantic description Grid services with the ODESGS tool (link). Additionally, UPM worked with the use case participants to provide appropriate technology support for the development of their systems. the final report (https://oeg.fi.upm.es/www.ontogrid.eu/ontogrid/download/OntoGrid-FinalPublishableReport.pdf), the publication of the project that appeared in eStrategies, and the Semantic Grid site (http : //www.semanticgrid.org/).


## Some relevant results
This section will include descriptions of some of the most relevant results of the project as they are produced.
