## General description

The GeoBuddies project has developed an application that provides geospatial information and services, anywhere and at any time, for pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago. The application supports mobile, dynamic and context-dependent access and interaction with a set of resources and services, with the support of information provided by the National Geographic Institute (IGN).

The application is based on a platform (GeoBuddies) that includes algorithm implementations for the following aspects:

* Integration of information based on ontologies, which is used to harmonize the multilingual and heterogeneous databases provided by the IGN;
* Social annotation of resources and services, which provides the necessary information to derive user communities;
* Collaborative filtering, which provides recommendations based on user communities;
* Dynamic composition and execution of services, to be used for the dynamic creation and use of value-added services based on the context of the user;
* Data transfer and reliability in mobile environments, which ensure that data that is relevant to a user is always available for the services that use them and for the mobile devices that the user uses.
