## General description

In recent years, several research groups in Spain have begun to work in the area of Linked Data. These groups participate separately both in important European initiatives and consortia, as well as in collaborations with national and international companies and institutions. Objectives: The proposed national thematic network is open to new members and its main objective is to facilitate the exchange and transfer of knowledge between national research groups associated with Universities, Technology Centers and companies). Likewise, an attempt will be made to increase the exchange and transfer of knowledge with Spanish researchers who are currently working abroad in related areas. We believe that promoting the exchange and transfer of knowledge will also increase the international visibility of Spanish research in Linked Data, as well as greater internal cohesion.

To achieve this general objective, a series of instruments have been defined, which are detailed below:

* Periodic research and evangelization meetings, with companies and public administrations, under the format of voCamps,

* Linked Data meetups, and business breakfasts;

* Creation of training itineraries and educational material (online tutorials, transparencies, etc.);

* Promotion of the mobility of researchers throughout the national territory.
