## General description
For years, a large amount of scientific literature related to coronaviruses has been generated, especially since 2003. In such a way that since mid-March the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence has launched a repository of more than 40,000 scientific documents in English, from among of which the full text of more than 33,000 is available. And the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has enlisted the help of the Artificial Intelligence community to process all of this information.

This scientific documentation represents, at the same time, a great help and a problem. Its exploration, management and location is particularly complex if you want to know the application or use of a drug in the treatment of COVID-19, as well as identify relationships between drugs to propose new action protocols, since you have to navigate through this great corpus of documentation, where the drugs are mentioned by different names: the commercial, the active principle, the therapeutic group, etc.

At DRUGS4COVID we are processing and indexing this corpus of articles and all the phrases in which active principles, therapeutic groups, symptoms and diseases are mentioned. We are automatically annotating, using Artificial Intelligence techniques, each article and each sentence with this information, and asking for the help of citizen scientists to review these annotations and propose relationships between them. At the end, we will publish a knowledge graph with all the correct data.

All these results will appear, open to everyone, with applications that facilitate the search and navigation of the documents for our users. In addition, they will be published in the form of open data that can be used by the entire scientific community and by any other team that can solve additional problems.


## Role of the oeg in this project
More specifically, in this project the OEG-UPM is working fundamentally in:
From the OEG, a multidisciplinary group of researchers and professionals, with the support of the ETSIINF and the UPM, has participated in the Virtual Hackathon of the Community of Madrid #VenceAlVirus with the DRUGS4COVID project, which combines Artificial Intelligence and Citizen Science techniques to analyze all the medical scientific literature that is available to the sector, and provide a solution that allows the information to be located without problems.



## Some relevant results
This section will include descriptions of some of the most relevant results of the project as they are produced.
