CORDIS: https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/761999



## General description

The prime motivation of EasyTV is the necessity of equal access to television and audio-visual services to ensure that all users, especially persons with disabilities, the growing ageing population of Europe and users with special needs can derive maximum benefit in terms of choice and quality of media content and services. More specifically the main objectives of the EasyTV project are the following:

* To provide innovative access services for improved multimedia viewing, hearing and description

* Hyper-personalisation of the content experience and interaction

* Novel technologies for the interaction with content and users thus breaking the language barrier for persons with disabilities

* To implement a technical platform which is able to integrate different services aiming at allowing persons with disabilities to access contents in a simple and intuitive manner via different terminals

* To validate EasyTV resulting technologies with users in a coherent methodology

* To liaise with relevant European accessibility organisations and create needed impact



## Role of the OEG in this project

More specifically, in this project the OEG-UPM is working fundamentally on the development of the EASTYV ontology and the Natural Language pipeline to semantically annotate and link concepts and entities in sign language.
