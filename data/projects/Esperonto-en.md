## General description

Esperonto Services (Application Service Provision of Semantic Annotation, Aggregation, Indexing and Routing of Textual, Multimedia, and Multilingual Web Content - IST-2001-34373) aimed to overcome the problem of information overload by adding meaning to the Web , which can be exploited by software agents so that people and companies can delegate tasks. Esperonto's goal was to bridge the gap between the past World Wide Web and the Semantic Web by providing a service to "upgrade" existing content to Semantic Web content. 

Ontologies play a key role in this effort, with the aim of unifying, linking and integrating heterogeneous, international and multilingual digital content. Once the Semantic Web content is available, the project aimed to exploit this content through innovative graphical navigation and distributed prototyping in value-added services. 

The main objective of the project was to design and develop a technological infrastructure for the creation of islands of the Semantic Web. The general objective is broken down into several concrete and measurable objectives:

* Create a technological infrastructure based on ontologies for the management of content semantics,

* Create a technological infrastructure that (semi) automatically annotates existing content with semantic information (metadata),

* Create a technological infrastructure to deal with multilingual content,

* The design and prototype of a technological infrastructure to store and access Semantic Web content, as well as the routing of Semantic Web content requests in a scalable and decentralized way,
* Illustrate the added value of Semantic Web technology in the development of three case studies in the public administration and the biotechnology sector.

## Role of the oeg in this project
The OEG was involved in the development of methodologies, techniques, tools and services to reduce the gap between the previous Web and Semantic Web. Specifically, OEG has participated in the construction of the following results:

- Container technologies and methodologies to update the content of the Semantic Web:
  - R2O R2O and ODEMapster. ODEMapster transforms the contents of the database into the contents of the semantic web (RDF), according to the assignments specified in the R2O language;
  - ODESWS allows the creation of Semantic Web Services through a user interface that is based on solving problems by the modeling method.
- The refinement of the WebODE ontological engineering platform with new import and export services, version control and evolution services and more usable editing facilities. In addition, it includes the following components, which have been identified separately as Esperonto results: an ontology alignment service and the evaluation of the ODEval module. Also, a translation module called OntoTranslate. The ontology editor supports the translation of ontology terms for several languages (Spanish, English and German) and its interface is available in these languages. In addition, the platform allows to store and retrieve the ontology terms in several languages.
- The Semantic Web portal generation system ODESeW ..

Additionally, OEG was involved in the development of core ontologies to be used as top-level ontologies, as well as domain ontologies from culture (art), funding organizations, and biotechnology. Kernel ontologies of time, space, units of measure, and physical quantities have been developed and are available to the public.
