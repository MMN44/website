## General description

OntoCommons is an H2020 CSA project dedicated to the standardisation of data documentation across all domains related to materials and manufacturing.

OntoCommons lays the foundation for interoperable, harmonised and standardised data documentation through ontologies, facilitating data sharing and pushing data-driven innovation, to bring out a truly Digital Single Market and new business models for European industry, exploit the opportunities of digitalisation and address sustainability challenges.


Main OntoCommons objectives are:

1. Develop a ready-to-use Ontology Commons EcoSystem (OCES) for data documentation, including a set of ontologies and tools;

2. Cooperate & Engage with relevant stakeholders at both EU and international level to collect existing resources and tools for data storage and identify possible bottlenecks;

3. Deliver a set of Demonstration Cases built upon the OCES that will prove the effectiveness of our approach through activities of harmonisation, standardisation and coordination;

4. Develop and roll-out an OntoCommons Roadmap that will include a number of recommendations for policy instruments towards Data Sharing for the European Single Market.


## Role of the OEG in this project

More specifically, in this project the OEG-UPM is working fundamentally on the development of the OntoCommons ontology development methodology and related toolkit.
