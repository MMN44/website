## General description

Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a critical element in the digitalization of the construction industry, which isnecessary in order to unleash huge efficiency and productivity improvements. BIMERR aims at designing and developinga toolkit including tools to support renovation stakeholders throughout the renovation process of existing buildings. A crucial aspect of the toolkit is the interoperability between BIMERR partners tools as well as with third-party legacy ICT tools in order to enable seamless BIM creation and information exchange among AEC stakeholders in an effort to enhance the rapid adoption of BIM in the renovation of the existing building stock in the EU countries. 


In order to achieve its objectives, BIMERR relies upon 3 key elements:

1. Interoperability throughout the BIM ecosystem, to ensure information exchange in a semantically and syntactically coherent manner

2. Renovation process improvement, to address the key issue of lacking adequate digital models

3. Innovative renovation-support tools for end-users, to lower entry barriers for the proliferation of building renovation activities


## Role of the oeg in this project
More specifically, in this project the OEG-UPM is working fundamentally on data modelling and standardization activities, namely surveying and analysing existing data models and  ontologies, creating the project ontologies and corresponding data models.
