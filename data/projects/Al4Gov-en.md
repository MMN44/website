## General description
AI4Gov is a project funded by [CEF](https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility) that aims at creating an international master on the application of Artificial Intelligence in Public Administrations. It targets employees working on public administrations (who will need to understand the potential of AI-based solutions for their organisations and oversee contracting processes for these products and services) and professionals who are willing to provide AI-based services for public administrations. Students will understand the landscape of AI techniques that may be applicable in their organisations and will work on several real projects, following a problem-based learning approach, that will provide them a deeper understanding of some of them.  


## Role of the oeg in this project
Our group coordinates the project and will setup the master together with the other three consortium members: Politecnico de Milano, FAU and TalTech.
