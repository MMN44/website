## General description

The project mIO! (Technologies to provide mobility services in the future intelligent universe) aims to develop technologies that provide ubiquitous services in intelligent environments and that can be adapted to the user's context. Said technologies will serve as the basis for interaction from the mobile terminal with both (micro) -services provided by companies and (micro) -services created and provided by mobile users. In this way, the main objective of the mIO! is to allow the user to interact through their mobile device both with available services and with services created and provided by it. 



## Role of the oeg in this project
The OEG is involved in the development of the network of ontologies to model knowledge about the user's context. These ontologies are used to adapt the behavior of a service according to the user's situation. Knowledge about context refers both to the user's context (location, temperature, preferences, social information, etc.) and to the context of the service (availability, cost, etc.). The OEG is also involved in the project by providing and reviewing possible usage scenarios.
