## General description

The objective of the SEEMP (Single European Employment Market-Place) project is to design and implement a prototype of an architecture for e-Employment services that encompasses business and government processes, interoperability and reconciliation of local professional profiles and taxonomies, semantic web services to share and access knowledge.

## Role of the oeg in this project
The ontological engineering group is involved in the semantic aspects of architecture. For this purpose the resulting architecture will have:

* a Reference Ontology, the main component of the system, which will act as a language in the form of a controlled set of vocabularies to describe information regarding job offers and CVs;
* a set of local ontologies, for each Employment Agency to use its own local ontology, which describes the labor market in its own terms;
* a set of correspondences between each local ontology and the reference ontology;
* a set of correspondences between the resources of the Employment Agencies and the local ontologies.


## Some relevant results
This section will include descriptions of some of the most relevant results of the project as they are produced.
