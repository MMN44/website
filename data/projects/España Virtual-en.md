## General description

Virtual Spain is an R&D project, subsidized by the CDTI within the Ingenio 2010 program, aimed at defining the architecture, protocols and standards of the future 3D Internet, with a special focus on 3D visualization, interaction between users and the introduction of semantic aspects. This project aims to lay the foundations for a future ecosystem of multimedia content and interactive services that brings together the technologies known as Web 2.0 with social, semantic and geographical aspects in a new generation of 3D tools for interaction with the virtual world.



## Role of the oeg in this project
The Ontology Engineering Group participates in the following lines of research:

* ** Information integration ** : The UPM performs tasks on new algorithms for processing geographic information, social communication and collaboration and semantics and the intelligent Web. In this context, the lines of work are focused on:
  * Implement the extension of a mapping language and its inference engine;
  * Develop automatic discovery techniques for mappings between an ontology and various sources of information, with which it is intended to achieve a process of semantic integration of various sources of geospatial knowledge;
  * Generate geospatial Linked Data from various information sources (databases) of the National Geographic Institute of Spain (IGN) and the National Geographic Information Center (CNIG). With this task, the Data Web has begun to be enriched with geospatial data from the Spanish national territory;
  * Develop a system capable of automatically performing the syntactic description and semantic annotation of existing non-semantic information sources.
* ** Semantic techniques in virtualization **: In this area, the UPM deals with the development of a semantic meta-planner, whose architecture follows the reference semantic grid architecture, called S-OGSA, and the construction of various ontologies to provide the computing systems of the ability to infer knowledge. This ability will allow more appropriate decisions to be made, since they can be carried out based on more precise knowledge.
* ** Social Semantic Web (Social Semantic Web) **: The UPM performs various tasks focused on:
  * Design and implementation of an algorithm that allows associating semantic entities to labels, improving the information retrieval or recommendation processes caused by the lack of explicit and formal semantics of the labels generated in social labeling systems. This algorithm can be tested in the following [link] (http://robinson.dia.fi.upm.es:8080/SemanticTagsWebApp/index.jsp)
  * Annotation of various resources available on the Web (texts, images, videos, etc.) and enrichment of the annotated results with information from semantic information sources of the Web of Data.
