## General description
Researchers investigate radiation damage of reactor pressure vessel (RPV) steels in nuclear plants to gain vital information for integrity assessment. To further this objective, the EU-funded ENTENTE project intends to design a European database for radiation embrittlement experimental and modelling data, where data produced in previous EU-funded projects and within ENTENTE will be collected, cured and stored. New experiments and models will be established to fill knowledge gaps and Process-Structure-Properties-Performance workflows will be developed, based on artificial intelligence tools, to make robust use of new and existing data using data-driven modelling techniques and data informatics. International collaboration is guaranteed by the participation of Japan and Ukraine within the consortium and a strong link with NEA, IAEA and other EU-funded projects on database activities
