## General description

UpGrid, "Ubiquitous access to A / V content based on UPnP", was a project financed by the AVANZA Program of the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce during the years 2008, 2009 and 2010. It has been coordinated by Telefónica I + D and iSOCO and the OEG group of the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM) have participated. 

The objective of this project was to introduce semantic technologies in homes. Before this project, home computers could share their multimedia files (videos, music, photos) relatively easily. In this project, the file sharing capabilities were expanded, so that, by indicating our social networks, the system is capable of sharing files with our family and friends. In addition, the system allows the owners, or authorized persons, to provide semantics to the files. This semantic information allows a user to make queries in natural language such as "show me the files where my nephew appears", or "play the music that my girlfriend and I liked", in which the information from the network is used social, or in which information from the social network is mixed with information from the user's files and annotations, as in "Show me the videos from last summer, less than 30 seconds long, in which my girlfriend and I appear."
